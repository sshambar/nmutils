# dispatcher_action v1.4.0 - service restart on interface change
# Author: Scott Shambarger <devel@shambarger.net>
#
# This file supports the same functions as 96-interface-action, but allows
# re-ordering the action relative to other dispatchers.  However, it requires
# an extra config step.
#
# The extra step is creating a file named
#
#   /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/##-ifd-<service>
#
# (or wherever your distro has these files) where <##> is a 2-digit
# number, and <service> is a systemd service name.  The file should be
# executable and contain the following:
#
# --- start
# #!/bin/bash
# . /etc/nmutils/dispatcher_action
# --- end
#
# The configuration settings are documented in 96-interface-action, but
# those settings are should instead be placed in:
#
#   /etc/nmutils/conf/ifd-<service>-<interface>.conf
#
# NOTE: If any PRE_DOWN actions are used, the ##-ifd-<service> script
#       should be symlinked to the pre-down.d directory.
#
# shellcheck shell=bash disable=SC1090
interface=${1-}
action=${2-}
